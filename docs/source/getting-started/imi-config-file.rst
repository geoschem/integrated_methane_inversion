       Default value ``0`` prevents exit.

Job Resource Allocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These settings are used to allocate resources (CPUs and Memory) to the different simulations needed to run the inversion.
Note: some python scripts are also deployed using slurm and default to using the ``RequestedCPUs`` and ``RequestedMemory`` settings. 
If the inversion step requires more resources than the rest of the IMI workflow, using the optional ``InversionCPUs`` and ``InversionMemory`` 
variables can be convenient.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30, 70
   :class: tight-table

     - Optional Variable. Max amount of time to allocate to inversion sbatch job (eg. "0-6:00") if different from ``RequestedTime``.
   * - ``InversionTime``
     - Optional Variable. Amount of memory to allocate to the inversion job (in MB) if different from ``RequestedMemory``.
   * - ``SchedulerPartition``

   * - ``MaxSimultaneousRuns``
     - The maximum number of jacobian simulations to run simultaneously. The default is -1 (no limit) which will submit all jacobian simulations at once. If the value is greater than zero, the sbatch array statement will be modified to include the "%" separator and will limit the number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array to the specifed value.
   * - ``NumJacobianTracers``
     - The number of tracers to use for each jacobian simulation. A value of 1
       will create and submit a jacobian run for each state vector element. 
       Specifying a value greater than 1 will combine state vector elements 
       into fewer runs. The default values is 5 tracers per simulation.
