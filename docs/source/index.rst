The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) workflow is a cloud-computing tool for quantifying methane emissions
by inversion of satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). 
It uses `GEOS-Chem <http://geos-chem.org>`_ as forward model for the inversion and infers methane emissions 
at 25 Ã— 25 km\ :sup:`2`\  resolution.

This site provides instructions for using the IMI, including launching an AWS compute instance, 
configuring and running an inversion, and analyzing the results with a ready-made jupyter notebook.

Some instructions are specific to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, but the IMI can also be run on a 
local compute cluster either manually building the environment or using a docker container.
