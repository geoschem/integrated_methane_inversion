## Directions to generate the boundary conditions.

1. Download and run the GEOS-Chem model for the time period you want to generate boundary conditions for:

   ```bash
   cd ./GC_Config_files
   git clone https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git
   cd GCClassic
   git checkout 14.0.2
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   sbatch geoschem.run

2. Run the series of python scripts via run_BCs.sh.
- `write_tropomi_GC_daily_avgs.py` writes a netCDF file that has daily averages of TROPOMI and what TROPOMI would have seen over a GEOS-Chem atmosphere.
- `calculate_bias.py` uses these daily biases (along with some spatial and temporal smoothing) to determine a bias for the entire globe each day.
- `write_boundary.py` applies these corrections to the boundary conditions generated by the above GEOS-Chem run and writes out the new boundary conditions.

    ```bash
    sbatch run_BCs.sh
